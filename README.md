# design-to-life
Bringing Dribbble/Uplabs prototypes to life and learning cool new things while doing it.

There's many things that I have not touched. To explore those parts and to also have fun while doing it, I will list everything I intend to learn, find a prototype/design from [Dribbble.com](http://dribbble.com) and/or [Uplabs](http://material.uplabs.com) that incorporates it and bring that design to life. The idea is that by getting my hands dirty by working a real thing I will obtain a much better understanding of the intricacies of whatever I am learning.

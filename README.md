# design-to-life
There's many things that I have not touched. To explore those parts and to also have fun while doing it, I will find a design from [Dribbble.com](http://dribbble.com) and/or [Uplabs](http://material.uplabs.com) and bring that design to life. 

I am an ardent believer of the fact that attaining mastery of a subject requires lots of practice. Therefore by getting my hands dirty **daily** working on real things I hope to attain mastery of Vue.js and it's intricacies.
